#Expected Length of male retirement in Brazil

In this paper, We analyze the evolution and the determinants of male retirement of Brazilian workers from 1980 to 2025.
We use historical data on labor force participation to estimate in retirement for these workers, for the years after 
2010 We use the Lee-Carter Model to project Mortality and Labor Force Participation rates. We find a steady and fast 
decline in the labor force participation of older workers and that these workers leave the labor force at ages in which
pension benefits are first available. We also find that the expected length of retirement is expected to double from 
1980 to 2025, and most of the change is explained by the decline in mortality rates. This trend, together with population
aging and longer life expectancy reduce the ratio between workers and retirees affecting the basic premise of the PAYGO system.
